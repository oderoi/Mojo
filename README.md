## Mojo Programming Language

 Mojo is the new programming language that combine the best of Python dynamic features with system programming of C++ and Rust performance by utilizing the next generation compiler technology, autotuning and compile-time metaprogramming features.

 Mojo will allow users to bult high performance libraries that currently require C, C++, Rust, CUDA and other accelerator systems that as well works across levels of abstraction.

 Mojo will targert accelerators and other heterogeneous systems that are pervasive in the AI field. THis meant a programming language with powerful compile-time metaprogramming, intergration of adaptive compilation techniques, caching throughout the compilation flow and other features that are not supported by existing languages.

 Aplied AI system need to address all these issues, and we decided there was no reason it couldn't be done with just one language.

Mojo support compile-time metaprogramming built into the compiler as a separate stage of compilation-after parisng, semantic analysis and IR generation, but runtime programs as it does for metaprograms, and leverages MLIR to represent and evaluate these programs predictably.
